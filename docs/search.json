While in undergrad, I interned at Charleston Waterkeeper, an environmental non-profit focused on protecting and restoring Charleston‚Äôs waterways. From there I worked in Alaska as a Fisheries Observer shortly during the pandemic. Following observing, I worked at Southern Illinois University for two and a half years as a Researcher specifically looking at movement of invasive Silver Carp primarily on the Wabash River. Finally, I worked briefly with the US Geological Survey in Cook, WA focusing on the outmigration of Chinook Salmon following dam removals on the Lower Klamath River.¬†\nCurrently, under the advisement of Dr.¬†Lisa Izzo, my graduate project is documenting the habitat use and spawning of walleye in Watts Bar Reservoir in Tennessee."

I am also interested in understanding the thermal ecology of fishes across different systems and how that relates to future habitat availability under a changing climate. I often use telemetry (acoustic or radio) to address research questions, but integrate that technique with various other laboratory and field-based methods in fisheries science, including hydroacoustics, age and growth analysis, and conventional tagging. Through my research, I aim to directly address issues of importance to fisheries managers in the region."
