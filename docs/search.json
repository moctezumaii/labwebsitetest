    "text": "This project is the ideal opportunity to study fish response to stream rehabilitation in an understudied region of the US. Following large-scale deforestation and channelization efforts across West Tennessee in the 19th and 20th centuries, in-stream connectivity and habitat availability decreased significantly, while the effects of erosion and flooding became more pronounced. In this region, grade control structures are commonly used to stop active head cutting and sedimentation issues; however, these structures can act as additional barriers to fish movement throughout the stream, and do not address the habitat needs of recovering fish communities.\nCub Creek, a headwater stream of the Hatchie River, is a prime example of a disturbed stream system in West Tennessee. It underwent drastic land use changes and channelization to create viable farmland, eventually leading to severe headcutting and bank destabilization via erosion. There is limited pre-disturbance ecological data, so it is hard to characterize the community composition changes that might have occurred.\nHowever, these changes certainly reduced the amount of available habitat and impeded the ability of fish to move between stream reaches. Thus, the rehabilitation project lead by the West Tennessee River Basin Authority (WTRBA) involved improving in-stream connectivity and microhabitat availability/variety. To facilitate connection between severely eroded reaches, WTRBA engineers designed a grade-control structure that should also function as a fish pass for small-bodied fishes. Moreover, many erosion control structures were chosen to double as microhabitat for aquatic organisms. Examples of these include root wads, log riffles, and large woody debris.\nHere at the UTK Fisheries and Aquatic Conservation Ecology Lab, we are assessing the efficacy of the rehabilitation design by monitoring fish movement through the grade-control structures using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Additionally, we will characterize in-stream habitat and use a mobile tag reader to detect fish and determine habitat use versus availability. By comparing rates of use of each habitat type to the amount available in the system, we can discern if fish are selecting for any particular habitat types or features."

While in undergrad, I interned at Charleston Waterkeeper, an environmental non-profit focused on protecting and restoring Charleston‚Äôs waterways. From there I worked in Alaska as a Fisheries Observer shortly during the pandemic. Following observing, I worked at Southern Illinois University for two and a half years as a Researcher specifically looking at movement of invasive Silver Carp primarily on the Wabash River. Finally, I worked briefly with the US Geological Survey in Cook, WA focusing on the outmigration of Chinook Salmon following dam removals on the Lower Klamath River.¬†\nCurrently, under the advisement of Dr.¬†Lisa Izzo, my graduate project is documenting the habitat use and spawning of walleye in Watts Bar Reservoir in Tennessee."

I am also interested in understanding the thermal ecology of fishes across different systems and how that relates to future habitat availability under a changing climate. I often use telemetry (acoustic or radio) to address research questions, but integrate that technique with various other laboratory and field-based methods in fisheries science, including hydroacoustics, age and growth analysis, and conventional tagging. Through my research, I aim to directly address issues of importance to fisheries managers in the region."

However, aquatic ecosystems are relatively poorly understood and under intense stress from human activities such as urbanization, water use, fishing, and climate change. I study how aquatic ecosystem functions and services, and animal communities and populations are shaped by natural and anthropogenic forces. My research seeks to find ways for healthy aquatic ecosystems and beneficial fisheries to persist in a human-dominated world."
