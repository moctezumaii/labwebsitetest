## About me

I graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts with my bachelor's in biology. While in undergrad I worked for the Smith College invertebrate lab doing research on coastal crab behavior and benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in our local river. After graduating, I worked for the Student Conservation Association and the National Park Service at Richmond National Battlefield Park and Yellowstone National Park doing ecosystem restoration and biological monitoring. Following my time in the park service, I worked for Iowa State University and Iowa DNR doing biological monitoring across the state of Iowa, and finally I just finished a biological monitoring position at Tall Timbers in Tallahassee, Florida. 

Currently my graduate project is studying bottomland hardwood wetland restoration in West Tennessee, documenting species diversity and habitat quality pre-restoration.
