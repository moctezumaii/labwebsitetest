## About me

I'm originally from Lexington, KY (Go Cats) üê±! I graduated from the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC with my bachelor's in marine biology. While in undergrad, I interned at Charleston Waterkeeper, an environmental non-profit focused on protecting and restoring Charleston's waterways. From there I worked in Alaska as a Fisheries Observer shortly during the pandemic. Following observing, I worked at Southern Illinois University for two and a half years as a Researcher specifically looking at movement of invasive Silver Carp primarily on the Wabash River. Finally, I worked briefly with the US Geological Survey in Cook, WA focusing on the outmigration of Chinook Salmon following dam removals on the Lower Klamath River.¬†

Currently, under the advisement of Dr. Lisa Izzo, my graduate project is documenting the habitat use and spawning of walleye in Watts Bar Reservoir in Tennessee.¬†
