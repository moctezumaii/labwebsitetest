## About me

I'm originally from Lexington, KY (Go Cats) 🐱!
I graduated from the College of Charleston in Charleston, SC with my bachelor's in marine biology.
While in undergrad, I interned at Charleston Waterkeeper, an environmental non-profit focused on protecting and restoring Charleston's waterways.
From there I worked in Alaska as a Fisheries Observer shortly during the pandemic.
Following observing, I worked at Southern Illinois University for two and a half years as a Researcher specifically looking at movement of invasive Silver Carp primarily on the Wabash River.
Finally, I worked briefly with the US Geological Survey in Cook, WA focusing on the outmigration of Chinook Salmon following dam removals on the Lower Klamath River. 

Currently, under the advisement of Dr. Lisa Izzo, my graduate project is documenting the habitat use and spawning of walleye in Watts Bar Reservoir in Tennessee.
