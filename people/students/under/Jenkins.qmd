## About Me

I am currently a senior studying Wildlife and Fisheries Management.
Since my freshman year, I have actively volunteered with various agencies and the aquatics lab, which has fueled my passion for fisheries and conservation.
As the current Fisheries President of the Wildlife and Fisheries Society, I have the privilege of providing other students with the same valuable opportunities that have shaped my own experience.
