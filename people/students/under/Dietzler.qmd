## About Me

I'm a sophomore at the University of Tennessee majoring in wildlife and fisheries science, and I joined the lab in November of last year as a technician.
I'm originally from Wisconsin and I spent most of my childhood hiking, fishing, and running around outside.
Working with the FACE lab has provided me with an awesome opportunity to turn these interests into usable skills and apply them in the field in a way that leaves behind a positive impact. 

## Interests

-   Ecosystem restoration

-   Non-game fish conservation

-   Interactions between aquatic and terrestrial species
