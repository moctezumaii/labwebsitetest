## About Me

Hi, my name is Marcus Owen .
I am a Wildlife and Fisheries student with a concentration in fisheries, and I'm from Anderson County, Tennessee.
I grew up on our state's great streams and lakes and now I hope to make them a part of my professional career.
Currently I am completing an undergraduate research project VIE tagging in Cub Creek, and hope to use my time in the FACE lab to gain valuable experience in the fisheries field.
