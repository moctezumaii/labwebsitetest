## About Me

I'm originally from Nolensville, TN and currently studying Wildlife and Fisheries Science with a management concentration.
I am a research assistant for the habitat use and spawning for walleye project under Brittnany Graham.
I hope to specialize in terrestrial or aquatic habitat management and concentration as my future career and hope to do more work abroad.
I am a Herbert Ambassador and on the executive board for MANRRS which is an organization that promotes professional development and networking from striving students pursuing a career in agriculture, natural resources, and/or related sciences.
After my Ichthyology course, I became interested with the fisheries world and pursued a role in research for a native species in Tennessee which landed me a position in the FACE lab.
