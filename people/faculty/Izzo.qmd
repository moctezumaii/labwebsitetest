## Biography

My research interests broadly focus on movement ecology and habitat use of fishes, and how that information can be used to assess and manage populations. I am also interested in understanding the thermal ecology of fishes across different systems and how that relates to future habitat availability under a changing climate. I often use telemetry (acoustic or radio) to address research questions, but integrate that technique with various other laboratory and field-based methods in fisheries science, including hydroacoustics, age and growth analysis, and conventional tagging. Through my research, I aim to directly address issues of importance to fisheries managers in the region. 

## Projects

Walleye in the Tennessee River - We will be using acoustic telemetry to track adult walleye in Watts Bar Reservoir. Through this project we will answer questions about movements, habitat use, and spawning site fidelity. Graduate Student: Brittnany Graham  

Alligator gar in western Tennessee tributaries - We are working with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to develop methods to investigate post-stocking survival and dispersal of alligator gar. We plan to scale this work up to using acoustic telemetry to address questions about alligator gar survival and dispersal that can be used to inform restoration programs for the species in Tennessee and throughout the Mississippi River basin.
