We are a fisheries research group based within the [School of Natural Resources](https://naturalresources.tennessee.edu/){.text-primary .text-decoration-none .fw-bolder target="_blank"} at the [UTIA](https://utia.tennessee.edu/){.text-primary .text-decoration-none .fw-bolder target="_blank"}. We work on all things fisheries, and aquatic ecology, management and conservation
