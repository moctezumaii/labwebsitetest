## About project

This project is the ideal opportunity to study fish response to stream rehabilitation in an understudied region of the US. Following large-scale deforestation and channelization efforts across West Tennessee in the 19th and 20th centuries, in-stream connectivity and habitat availability decreased significantly, while the effects of erosion and flooding became more pronounced. In this region, grade control structures are commonly used to stop active head cutting and sedimentation issues; however, these structures can act as additional barriers to fish movement throughout the stream, and do not address the habitat needs of recovering fish communities.

Cub Creek, a headwater stream of the Hatchie River, is a prime example of a disturbed stream system in West Tennessee. It underwent drastic land use changes and channelization to create viable farmland, eventually leading to severe headcutting and bank destabilization via erosion. There is limited pre-disturbance ecological data, so it is hard to characterize the community composition changes that might have occurred. However, these changes certainly reduced the amount of available habitat and impeded the ability of fish to move between stream reaches. Thus, the rehabilitation project lead by the West Tennessee River Basin Authority (WTRBA) involved improving in-stream connectivity and microhabitat availability/variety. To facilitate connection between severely eroded reaches, WTRBA engineers designed a grade-control structure that should also function as a fish pass for small-bodied fishes. Moreover, many erosion control structures were chosen to double as microhabitat for aquatic organisms. Examples of these include root wads, log riffles, and large woody debris.

Here at the UTK Fisheries Group, we are assessing the efficacy of the rehabilitation design by monitoring fish movement through the grade-control structures using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. Fish meeting minimum size requirements are tagged with 12mm HDX PIT tags that are detectable by RFID-compatible antennas. At each of the two passages, an array of four RFID antennas detect tagged fish; two antennas are located upstream and two are located downstream, enabling us to detect fish entering from either direction, determine rates of successful passage, and calculate the amount of time each successful passage takes. Additionally, we will characterize in-stream habitat and use a mobile tag reader to detect fish and determine habitat use versus availability. By comparing rates of use of each habitat type to the amount available in the system, we can discern if fish are selecting for any particular habitat types or features.
